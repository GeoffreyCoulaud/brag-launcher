A game launcher for **linux** where your library is the star of the show.

## Why ?
> I'm so tired of interfaces that include 9 out 10 of my games. I want it all in one, pretty, place ! 

If you think alike, I believe Brag is for you. 

However, if you want a single place to install, configure and manage your games, 
this is not the intended purpose of Brag. This project is for *brag*ging, showing off your library. 
You will have to install other software to manage your games, they will definitely do it better.

1. **Steam**, **Legendary** and **Heroic** only allow starting games, not stopping or killing them
2. **Citra** and **Yuzu** installed games are not scanned (only roms are scanned)

## Usage
**Brag is in active development but is just not there yet. Be patient !**

### Dependencies
* Main app 
	* `node` 
	* `npm`
* Node-Gtk ([refer to the docs](https://github.com/romgrk/node-gtk#installing-and-building)) : 
	* `git`
	* `python2` (for `node-gyp`)
	* a C compiler (`gcc`â‰¥8 or `clang`)
* Supported sources programs (optional)

### Dev usage
1. Install the dependencies mentionned above.
2. Clone this repo and `cd` into it.  
3. Install NPM dependencies `npm i`
4. Start `npm run start`

## Known issues
* Games from Steam, Legendary, Heroic can be started but not stopped or killed
* Cemu in lutris is a clunky solution, but it's the best we currently have on linux

## TODO
* Implement UI (see [dedicated document](./resources/ui_design_process.md))
* Dolphin : Scan cached games
* Dolphin : Differenciate between Gamecube and Wii games
* Yuzu : Scan installed games
* Citra : Scan installed games
* Add a better way to handle nested sources
* Better installation instructions
* Additional sources
	* itch.io
	* Retroarch (in Steam)
	* Bethesda launcher (in Lutris)
	* Origin (in Lutris)
	* Battle_net (in Lutris)
	* Uplay (in Lutris)
	* Teknoparrot (in Lutris)(create installer first)
* Fix game metadata (see [dedicated document](./resources/fixing_game_metadata.md))
* Regroup duplicate games entries (eg. PPSSPP & Retroarch) into a "multiple source game"
