# Brag
A game launcher for **linux** where your library is the star of the show.

## Why, how ?
> I'm so tired of interfaces that inlude 9 out 10 of my games. I want it all in one, pretty, place ! 

If you think alike, I believe Brag is for you. 

However, if you want a single place to install, configure and manage your games, 
this is not the intended purpose of Brag. This project is for *brag*ging, showing off your library. 
You will have to install other software to manage your games, they will definitely do it better.
