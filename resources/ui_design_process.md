# Brag's UI
## Mockups
These images were made to give a rough idea of what the UI should look like.  
I used [Pencil](https://pencil.evolus.vn/) to make these mockups, although I don't recommend using it since the project seems to be inactive for quite some months.  
I took inspiration from [Lutris](https://github.com/lutris/lutris).

[MockupImage2]: https://github.com/GeoffreyCoulaud/brag-launcher/blob/main/resources/mockup2.png "Scanning view replacing the default view"
[MockupImage3]: https://github.com/GeoffreyCoulaud/brag-launcher/blob/main/resources/mockup3.png "Game info popover with a start button"
[MockupImage4]: https://github.com/GeoffreyCoulaud/brag-launcher/blob/main/resources/mockup4.png "Game info popover with a stop and kill button"
